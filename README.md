# Perspective Inspection Eye Care (SPECTION) - Clinical Health Care Website with Health Care Analytics and Clinical Reservation Appointment System
## Background

A healthcare website is an online application that connects people using the internet. This research paper focuses on the online healthcare website that aims to develop starter clinics. The website is almost the same with the various healthcare websites on the internet but has a different feature. Many companies invested in online websites like Roque eye clinic and American eye center Philippines because of its advantageous benefits not just connect people online without going physically to the clinic but also it has many sources you can read and understand the importance of your health. 

Since many eye clinic websites that are broad and starter clinics are incapable of acquiring them. Spection provides them a customized website specifically for them. What makes Spection different are the targeted starter ophthalmologist clinics and has a feature that are designed for them locally to maximize its capabilities and it’s feature of helping many patients as possible. 

In conclusion only big companies that has the advantage of providing online healthcare websites to cater many patients as possible. But that makes no difference of the starter clinics because in general many patients cannot regularly check their health because the lack of time and wealth to inquire at big clinics that has an online website to reduce their time of inquiring and attending appointments.
