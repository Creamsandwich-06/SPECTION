It's simply built on Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and has a feature to analyze patients overview with the use of Healthcare Analytics that create graphical trend of data. It is simply a conversion storing hard copies of data into softcopy with a secure database. 

 Spection is a web based application. It carries out the function of maintaining patients’ medical details. The users can add patients, enter medical history about them, schedule appointment for medical checkups, enter diagnosis for all appointments, and generate reports. As it is a web based application it can be accessed from anywhere at any time from desktops and mobiles. So doctors need not waste their time by writing the details on papers and storing papers by maintaining proper order which may increase the probability of losing data and also it saves time on booking appointments for patients since we can book appointments online even during our free time instead of going to a particular place to book appointments for our loved ones in person. We have provided login facility to users and admin panel to maintain different user accounts like doctor, receptionist etc. The privacy of data is considered as utmost priority so that no one can misuse the data stored in our database.
 
The graphical trend will serve as an overview of the diagnosis and diseases experienced by the patients. Gives the doctor’s knowledge and awareness. With Spection, medical health practitioners can provide quick response to various health concerns as it provides efficient ways of accommodating patients alike.
